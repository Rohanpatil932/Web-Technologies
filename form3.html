         <div class="box3">Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. The target of Java is to write a program once and then run this program on multiple operating systems. The first publicly available version of Java (Java 1.0) was released in 1995.</div>

            <div class="b8">Java is a high-level language, which represents logical computer concepts in a fashion that is easier for humans to understand than low-level machine code or assembly language. However, this means that in order to run on a machine, the code must be compiled into machine code or interpreted by a special-purpose machine. To achieve its goal of "Write once, run anywhere," Java does both: a Java compiler converts Java code into machine-readable bytecode, then the Java Virtual Machine interprets the code for the computer it runs on.</div>
